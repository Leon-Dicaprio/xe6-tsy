# Voice session foundation

This package owns the business lifecycle for Issue #86 voice sessions.

## State ownership

| State | Owner | Persistence boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `voice_sessions.status` | `services/api/sessions` | Persistent business lifecycle |
| `runtime_state` | `services/realtime-audio` | Media-plane runtime repository |
| `connection_state` | WebRTC connection manager | Live WebRTC connection state |
| language config | `services/api/languages` | Versioned language configuration |

The three session-related states are independent. This package never persists
runtime or connection state in `VoiceSession`.

## Ports and authorization boundaries

| Boundary | Provider | Consumer | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Repository` | infrastructure adapter | session service | Persistent business state and atomic idempotency |
| `LanguageConfigReader` | language module adapter | session service | Verify an active bilingual config |
| `WebRTCConnectionReader` | realtime WebRTC adapter | session service | Verify connection readiness before start |
| `RealtimeLifecycle` | realtime session adapter | session service | Start, stop, and read runtime state |
| `SessionReader` | session module | realtime and account modules | Read an immutable business-session snapshot |
| `RuntimeFailureConsumer` | session module | realtime session adapter | Mark a cleaned-up unrecoverable runtime failure |

External user flows must read a session through `Repository.GetOwned` or list
through a `ListFilter` with a non-empty `AccountID`. `SessionReader.GetSession`
is reserved for trusted internal modules and is not an authorization boundary.
The two read paths must not be interchanged.

`RealtimeLifecycle` and `LanguageConfigReader` are consumer-owned ports. Their
providers do not directly implement these interfaces: follow-up adapters map
provider commands and snapshots explicitly. Adapters must exhaustively map
`RuntimeState`, `ConnectionState`, `EndReason`, language-config status, and time
fields; unchecked string conversion is not an integration contract.

## Create flow

```text
validate authenticated request
-> generate session ID
-> Repository.Create(session + create idempotency record)
-> return the created persistent session
```

Create does not start realtime, query runtime state, or create runtime records.

## Start flow

```text
Repository.GetOwned
-> if active, use TransitionToActive to validate and replay the stored result
-> otherwise require business status = created
-> require LanguageConfigSnapshot.Ready()
-> require ConnectionState.Ready()
-> RealtimeLifecycle.Start
-> Repository.TransitionToActive(created -> active + start idempotency result)
```

The realtime implementation reads a still-`created` session. If the final
transition fails after realtime startup, the service calls
`RealtimeLifecycle.Stop` as compensation and leaves the business session
`created`. `TransitionToActive` checks an existing idempotency record before
the expected-state condition, so a repeated matching start can return the
stored active session while the same key with a different hash conflicts.

## End and recovery flow

End-request idempotency belongs only to `EndIntent`; it is not repeated in
`EndTransitionParams`.

```text
serialize operations for session_id
-> Repository.GetOwned
-> Repository.SaveEndIntent(key + request hash + reason)
-> for active sessions: RealtimeLifecycle.Stop
-> require cleanup-confirmed RuntimeStopped
-> Repository.TransitionToEnded(expected current state -> ended)
-> Repository.CompleteEndIntent
```

A `created` session skips realtime Stop and transitions directly to `ended`.
For an `active` session, Stop failure, timeout, or unconfirmed cleanup leaves
the business status `active`, leaves `ended_at` unset, and preserves the
incomplete intent. A repeated request reads the intent:

- same idempotency key and request hash: resume incomplete work or return the
  completed result;
- same key with a different request hash: return
  `idempotency_key_conflict`;
- no intent: return `end_intent_not_found` when a recovery lookup is requested.

If Stop succeeds but the database transition fails, a retry invokes the
idempotent Stop again and retries the transition. An unrecoverable runtime
failure may use `TransitionToFailed` only after realtime confirms all owned
resources were cleaned up.

## Query flows

- Detail reads an owned persistent session and one live runtime snapshot.
- State reads only the owned business state and polling runtime fields.
- List returns `VoiceSessionListItem` values from persistent storage only.
- List never calls realtime per row or in batch and never filters by runtime or
  connection state.
- `Service.GetSession` is the trusted internal `SessionReader` implementation
  and uses `Repository.Get`; authenticated user flows always use
  `Repository.GetOwned`.

## Service orchestration

`NewService` requires the repository, language-config reader, WebRTC connection
reader, realtime lifecycle, ID generator, and clock. It does not initialize
databases, HTTP servers, or provider adapters.

Lifecycle operations for one session are serialized in process. Repository
conditional transitions remain the cross-process consistency boundary, and no
database transaction is held while realtime or WebRTC dependencies are called.

Start compensation ignores request cancellation but has a bounded timeout. If
realtime starts and `TransitionToActive` fails, the service calls idempotent
`Stop`, verifies a `stopped` snapshot, logs the request and session IDs, and
leaves the persistent session `created`.

End always saves `EndIntent` before cleanup. Stop errors, timeouts, an
unconfirmed `stopped` snapshot, or transition failures leave the intent
incomplete. Replaying the same request or calling `ResumeEnd` retries cleanup
and the conditional terminal transition.

## Idempotency ownership

| Operation | Owner | Atomic result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create | `Repository.Create` | session + create request result |
| Start | `Repository.TransitionToActive` | `created -> active` + start request result |
| End | `Repository.SaveEndIntent` | end request identity and resumable completion state |

## Current slice

This package now includes the domain foundation and independently testable
Service orchestration. HTTP handlers, route registration, OpenAPI,
repositories, and production adapters remain follow-up reviewable slices. No
stub returns fabricated success data. This slice does not change `main.go`,
`go.work`, shared authentication, shared error responses, or request-ID
middleware.
